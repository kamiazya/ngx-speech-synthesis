      <h3>Pitch {{f.pitch}}</h3>
      <p>This attribute specifies the speaking pitch for the utterance.</p>
      <p>It ranges between 0 and 2 inclusive, with 0 being the lowest pitch and 2 the highest pitch.</p>
      <p>1 corresponds to the default pitch of the speech synthesis engine or specific voice.</p>
      <p>Speech synthesis engines or voices may constrain the minimum and maximum rates further.</p>
      <p>If SSML is used, this value will be overridden by prosody tags in the markup.</p>

      <h3>Rate {{f.rate}}</h3>
      <p>This attribute specifies the speaking rate for the utterance.</p>
      <p>It is relative to the default rate for this voice.</p>
      <p>1 is the default rate supported by the speech synthesis engine or specific voice</p>
      <p>(which should correspond to a normal speaking rate).</p>
      <p>2 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. Values below 0.1 or above 10 are strictly disallowed,</p>
      <p>but speech synthesis engines or specific voices may constrain the minimum and maximum rates further,</p>
      <p>for example, a particular voice may not actually speak faster than 3 times normal</p>
      <p>even if you specify a value larger than 3.</p>
      <p>If SSML is used, this value will be overridden by prosody tags in the markup.</p>

      <h3>Voice</h3>
      <p>This attribute specifies the speech synthesis voice that the web application wishes to use.</p>
      <p>When a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object is created this attribute must be initialized to null.</p>
      <p>If, at the time of the speak() method call,</p>
      <p>this attribute has been set to one of the SpeechSynthesisVoice objects returned by getVoices(),</p>
      <p>then the user agent must use that voice. If this attribute is unset or null at the time of the speak()</p>
      <p>method call, then the user agent must use a user agent default voice.</p>
      <p>The user agent default voice should support the current language (see lang) and</p>
      <p>can be a local or remote speech service and can incorporate end user choices via interfaces</p>
      <p>provided by the user agent such as browser configuration parameters.</p>
